Week: 1 
Recitation: 2 
Problem: 1

Problem definition:
Suppose the next pointer of the last node of a linked list points to an earlier node in the list, 
creating a cycle. Given a pointer to the head of the list (without knowing its size), describe a 
linear-time algorithm to find the number of nodes in the cycle. Can you do this while using 
only constant additional space outside of the original linked list? 

Solution is given in the build_cycle() and get_cycle_size() methods below.
Implementation of get_cycle_size() is called Floydâ€™s Cycle-Finding Algorithm

    Insertion/Deletion at the i-th position: O(n), since we have to traverse till the i-th position
